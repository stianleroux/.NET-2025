## C# 13 Features

### Primary Constructors

C# 13 introduces **primary constructors**, a feature that simplifies class initialization. With primary constructors, parameters can be defined directly in the class declaration. This reduces the need for verbose constructor definitions and allows for more concise class definitions. This feature encourages a cleaner and more readable approach to object creation, making it easier to define and use classes in your code.

### Record Types with With-Expressions

Record types continue to evolve in C# 13. The language now enhances the **`with`** expression for working with immutable data. With the `with` expression, developers can easily create modified copies of immutable objects like records, reducing boilerplate and making code more declarative. This feature allows developers to work with data in a more functional style, with support for immutability and deep copying.

### String Interpolation Enhancements

String interpolation in C# 13 becomes more powerful and flexible. This feature now supports advanced formatting options, such as automatic currency formatting, culture-specific formatting, and easier handling of complex interpolated expressions. It provides developers with an efficient way to compose strings while maintaining readability and minimizing formatting errors.

### Pattern Matching Enhancements

C# 13 introduces advanced enhancements to **pattern matching**. These improvements allow for more expressive and fine-grained checks within the language. Patterns like `or` and `and` patterns allow more flexibility when performing conditional checks, and the addition of `is not null` provides a more expressive and readable way to check for `null`. This makes pattern matching more versatile and easier to work with, especially in complex scenarios.

## .NET 9 Features

### Minimal APIs with Enhanced Performance

.NET 9 continues to improve **Minimal APIs**, introduced in previous versions, to make building lightweight APIs even more streamlined. The updates provide performance optimizations, reduced boilerplate, and a simplified API surface, making it easier and faster to develop APIs that meet the needs of modern applications. Minimal APIs are designed to handle simple use cases efficiently, enabling developers to build high-performance APIs with less effort.

### Global Usings & Implicit Usings

In .NET 9, **global usings** have been enhanced to reduce code repetition. Global usings allow you to define commonly used namespaces at the project level, making them available across all files in the project without needing to explicitly import them in each individual file. This results in cleaner, more organized code and reduces the amount of boilerplate required to work with common namespaces.

### Source Generators for Improved Reflection

.NET 9 brings significant improvements to **Source Generators**, allowing developers to generate code at compile time rather than relying on reflection at runtime. This can result in significant performance improvements, as reflection can be costly, especially in high-frequency code paths. Source generators enable developers to automate code generation and provide more efficient alternatives to reflection, leading to better performance and cleaner code.

### Enhanced Blazor Support

Blazor, the framework for building interactive web UIs in C#, has received further optimizations in .NET 9. Enhancements to Blazor's rendering performance and better support for **WebAssembly (WASM)** allow for faster, more responsive web applications. These improvements make Blazor a more powerful tool for building client-side web applications, with better performance, reduced load times, and improved component reusability.

## Null Check Syntax in .NET 9 and C# 13

### `is null` vs `!= null`

With the introduction of **`is null`** in C# 13 and .NET 9, developers are encouraged to use this syntax for null checks instead of the traditional **`!= null`**. The **`is null`** syntax is more expressive, making the code easier to read and understand. This new syntax is part of the broader shift toward pattern matching in the language, and it enhances the readability of null checks, making them more declarative and clear in intent.

## Conclusion

C# 13 and .NET 9 bring a wealth of exciting features aimed at improving developer productivity, code readability, and performance. With enhancements like primary constructors, record types with `with` expressions, and advanced pattern matching, C# 13 allows for more expressive and concise code. On the .NET side, improvements to Minimal APIs, global usings, source generators, and Blazor support make .NET 9 a more powerful platform for building modern applications.

These changes represent a significant step forward in the evolution of the .NET ecosystem, providing developers with the tools they need to write cleaner, more efficient code and build high-performance applications with ease.
